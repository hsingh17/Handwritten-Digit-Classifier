# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier

## Description
I developed a small web app that classifies digits that are drawn on the canvas. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify the digits, and it was trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Languages & Framworks 
1. Javascript, HTML, CSS
    - Design the front end of the website that user interacts with.
2. ExpressJS
    - Design the server which has one POST route and spawns a subprocess that feeds input into the CNN. 
3. Python  
    - Design the CNN and makes predictions on new input.

## Project hosting
Project is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, which can be found [here](http://204.236.145.239:3000/).
